# DSAVisualizer

A terminal-based Java project to visualize core Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).  
It demonstrates fundamental concepts like sorting and stack operations in a clean, modular way.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Java-based, modular design
- ✅ Sorting algorithms: Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick
- ✅ Stack operations via custom Stack implementation
- ✅ Fully terminal-driven (no GUI) for deep DSA focus
- ✅ Great for interview prep and portfolio building

## 🧠 Why I Built This

As a B.Tech CSE student focused on cracking FAANG and top product-based companies,  
I built this project to:

- Reinforce my DSA concepts with hands-on coding
- Apply OOP principles in real-world practice
- Build a strong project for resume and GitHub portfolio
