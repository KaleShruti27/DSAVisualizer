# DSAVisualizer

A terminal-based Java project to visualize core Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).  
It demonstrates fundamental concepts like sorting and stack operations in a clean, modular way.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Java-based, modular design
- ✅ Sorting algorithms: Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick
- ✅ Stack operations via custom Stack implementation
- ✅ Fully terminal-driven (no GUI) for deep DSA focus
- ✅ Great for interview prep and portfolio building

## 🧠 Why I Built This

As a B.Tech CSE student focused on cracking FAANG and top product-based companies,  
I built this project to:

- Reinforce my DSA concepts with hands-on coding
- Apply OOP principles in real-world practice
- Build a strong project for resume and GitHub portfolio

## 💡 What's Next

> These features will be added in the next versions to expand the DSAVisualizer project:

### 🔃 Core DSA Modules
- [ ] Linked List (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
- [ ] Queue and Deque (Array + Linked List based)
- [ ] Tree Traversals (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder)
- [ ] Binary Search Tree Operations
- [ ] AVL Tree & Balanced BSTs
- [ ] Heaps (Min-Heap, Max-Heap)
- [ ] Graphs (BFS, DFS, Adjacency Matrix/List)
- [ ] Tries (Prefix Trees)
- [ ] Segment Trees

### 🌟 Enhancements
- [ ] GUI Integration (JavaFX / Web View)
